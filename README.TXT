For my portfolio website, I decided on a single page layout using smooth scroll, this is so people can navigate the website with ease, rather than clicking onto other pages when it not necessary, e.g with a click of a button they can scroll down and see the portfolio grid section, which saves time. Most of the layout is responsive with barely any media queries due to using flexbox, except for smaller mobile screens. The layout I used is modern and easy on the eyes with a simple colour scheme. 

  

Components on my website rely on JavaScript to work, I have a responsive hamburger menu navigation bar where the links animate in. For the skills section the skill bars wait for the user to scroll down to a certain point before they animate in. The contact form is validated which lets the user know if they have made an error when they have submitted, they get an alert saying the form has been submitted and last of all I made an animate on scroll function which waits for the element to be view at a certain point before it fires an animation.
